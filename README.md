Unfortunately Android things is being deprecated by Google in January 2022, which is such a shame, because combining IOT with Android programming was a game changer in my opinion and I was looking forward to doing more with this :(

The Rainbow HAT for RaspberryPi  has multiple sensors, inputs and displays to explore the Android Things OS and commands. 
It can be used as a weather station, a clock, a timer or stopwatch, a mood light, or endless other things.This add-on board features displays, sensors, sound, and lots of LEDs. 
It's the perfect introduction to developing Android Things applications on the Raspberry Pi.
